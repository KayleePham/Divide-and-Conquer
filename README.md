# Divide-and-Conquer
- Use "input3.text" for input file
- Reads a 2 sorted lists of integer data of size N from a file, stores that data into 2 linear data structures, 
finds the average of the 2 middle elements in time O(lg n) using divide and conquer, and finds the number of inversions
in the list that would be created by concatinating the 2 lists in time O(n) using divide and conquer.
